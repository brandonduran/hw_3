This is a basic language training app for beginners trying to learn romance languages. It has support for Spanish, French, and Italian. This would be useful for someone who is just starting to study a new language and is trying to learn the most basic phrases to start with. It's helpful because it also has the accompanying audio files so that not only could someone see how the words are written, they can also associate their pronounciation with the phrase too.
